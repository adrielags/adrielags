 Hello I am Adriel ðŸ‘‹


I studied Computer Engineering at CEFET-MG. I build and propose software solutions for a variety of problems. I have experience mainly with Java and .NET technologies for web and desktop application development. I love technology and software development, and this is my space to share some of my projects.
