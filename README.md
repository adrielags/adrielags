### Hello I am Adriel 👋
<!--
**adrielags/adrielags** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I studied Computer Engineering at CEFET-MG. I build and propose software solutions for a variety of problems. I have experience mainly with Java and .NET technologies for web and desktop application development. I love technology and software development and this is my space to share some of my projects.
:blush: .
